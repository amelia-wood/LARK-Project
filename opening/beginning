Welcome brave Wizard! Thank you for agreeing to help our people! 

Before you begin, here are some tips that will be useful on your journey.

	- Use the command “ls” to see nearby areas, spells, and beasts to fight.

	- You can cast a spell or fight a monster using the “./” command.

		- We recommend always casting the spell first so you can 
		add it to your spell book.

	- If you’d like to explore a new area, use the command "cd" to change 
	your current location. If you would like to go back to a previous area,
	use the command "cd .."

	- If you ever get stuck, use the command "cat pixie". The pixie will 
	remind you of everything you've learned so far.

To begin, try out the spells you see and then move on to the training dummy.
