Welcome brave Wizard! Thank you for agreeing to help our people! 

Before you begin, here are some tips that will be useful on your journey.

	- Use the command “ls” to see nearby areas, spells, and beasts to fight.

	- You can cast a spell or fight a monster using the “./” command.

		- We recommend always casting the spell first as it will be added to your spell book.

	- If you’d like to explore a new area, use cd to change your current location.


To begin, try out the spells you see and then move on to the training dummy.
