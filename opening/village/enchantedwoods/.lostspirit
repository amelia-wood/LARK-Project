The thick woods of the enchanted forest are easy to get lost in, but 
you find a clearing with the spirit of a child crying alone.

if [ "$choice" = "yes" -o "$choice" = "Yes" ]; then
	cat << EOF

You approach the lost spirit, and hug the child. When this happens, a 
bright light glows from the child and it disappears. In its place, another 
magical tome lies in its place. After reading through it, the magical tome 
is for the spell sleep. 

To add this to your spellbook, use the command: 

export Spells=sleep,\$Spells

elif [ "$choice" = "no" -o "$choice" = "No" ]; then
	cat << EOF

You leave the child alone, and continue looking for a way onward out
of the forest.
