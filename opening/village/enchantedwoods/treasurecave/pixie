Hello Wizard!

My name is Pearl the Helpful Pixie! Below are some helpful reminders
if you're stuck!

        - Use the command "ls" to see the nearby areas, spells, and beasts
        to fight.

        - To cast a spell, talk to someone, or fight a monster, use 
	the "./" command.

        - If you ever want to see the contents of your spellbook, use the
        command "echo $Spells".

	-If you ever want to see what you have in your pockets, use the 
	command "echo $Pockets".
