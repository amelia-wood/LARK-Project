cat << EOF

A friendly, non-harmful looking baby slime hops to you. The slime looks like 
it wants to show you something.
EOF

echo -n "Do you follow the slime? "

if [ "$choice" = "yes" -o "$choice" = "Yes" ]; then
	cat << EOF

The slime directs you to the way out of the forest. You must enter a cave 
that cuts to the other side of the mountain. Anything could be inside, so
be careful!

To enter the cave, use the command:

cd treasurecave

elif [ "$choice" = "no" -o "$choice" = "No" ]; then
	cat << EOF

The slime hops in place, waiting for you to follow it.
