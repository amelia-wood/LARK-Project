Hello Wizard!

My name is Pearl the Helpful Pixie! Below are some helpful reminders
if you're stuck!

        - Use the command "ls" to see the nearby areas, spells, and beasts
        to fight.

		- You can also use the command "ls -a" to see things that
		are hidden around you. 

        - To cast a spell, talk to someone, or fight a monster, use 
	the "./" command.

        - If you ever want to see the contents of your spellbook, use the
        command "echo $Spells".

	- If you ever want to see what you have in your pockets, use the 
	command "echo $Pockets".

	- To move from one area you can use the commands "cd" to move forward,
        or "cd .." to move backward.
