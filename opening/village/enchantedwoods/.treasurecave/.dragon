As you explore deeper into the cave, you find a dragon. It seems the only way 
out of here is to defeat the dragon. Choose wisely when it comes to which 
spells you cast, as only certain spells will work against this foe.

You cast freeze, the dragon is flash-frozen in place, like a shell of ice 
completely encased it. This won’t last for long, you’d better run past 
before it breaks free!"

To exit the cave before it's too late, use the command:

cd .castle

elif [ "$choice" = "sleep" -o "$choice" = "Sleep" ]; then
	cat << EOF

You cast sleep, the dragon’s eyes begin drooping closed and it falls over, 
making a loud THUD and shaking the cavern walls around you. Looks like the 
cave system is going to fall apart, you’d best get moving before you become 
stuck here!

To exit the cave before it's too late, use the command:

cd .castle
EOF

elif [ "$choice" != "$Spells" ]; then
	cat << EOF

The dragon seems humoured by your pitiful attempt of spellcasting, and 
breathes a large wave of fire onto you! 

You have been defeated, to face the dragon again use the command: 
        
./.dragon
