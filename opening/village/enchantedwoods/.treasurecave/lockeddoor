Before you lies a locked door. You search your pockets for a key which might 
open the locked handle, but find yourself key-less. There is no way you will 
get through this door normally, unlessâ€¦
EOF

echo "Do you: "
echo ""
echo "Pick the lock"
echo ""
echo "Leave"
echo ""
echo -n "Make your choice: "

read choice

if [ "$choice" = "pick the lock" -o "$choice" = "Pick the lock" -o "$choice" = "Pick the Lock" -o "$choice" = "pick lock" -o "$choice" = "Pick Lock" ]; then
	cat << EOF

After a few minutes of fiddling with the inside of the lock, you manage to pull 
the door open. Expecting something worth your while on the other side, you are 
disappointed as you find the room is a bedroom with not much to see inside. Upon 
further investigation, you find a rare-looking amulet with a smiley face on it. 

To add it to your inventory, us the command:

export Pockets=amulet,\$Pockets
EOF

elif [ "$choice" = "Leave" -o "$choice" = "leave" ]; then
	echo ""
